As you build multiple priorities—be it from school, home, work, and your own personal projects—you'll find yourself having multiple thoughts of what you can do in a day. Sometimes you'll over think and then before you know it several hours have passed without much progress. **I call this being spread thin.**

This would happen to me on several occasions. One of the causes which I feel impacts this is multitasking and distractions.

The past April has led me to create a website, more or less to document what I wish to learn, what I *have* to learn, and things I have to keep track of. As a programmer, focus is required to keep track of various projects. I must focus on my work in order to complete it. Taking time off to watch videos or play games would be considered a distraction that affects my code quality and time to finish. However, throughout my school life I've noticed I would multi-task on a daily basis so as to keep myself actively engaged in work for an extended period of time.
I feel as if this definitely would cut in to my learning experience.

As I am writing this first post, I'm currently recovering from my wisdom teeth extraction which has been aching my gums. I currently have Runescape open, training the Firemaking skill with bonfires *(This lets me have quite a bit of time to write up my blog post, taking around 3\*28=84 seconds or nearly a minute and a half)*, and watching OG vs Virtus Pro in the Dota 2 grand finals. Alongside this, I have plenty of thoughts on my mind about what I must or really like to do:

| Home Tasks                                                               | Work                                                                               | Personal Studying / Misc                                                                                 | School Prep                                          |   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Finish washing the dishes                                                | Focus more on learning the Symfony Framework                                       | I'd like to re-learn my graphic design skills, this time with business software (Photoshop, Illustrator) | Re-Learn Calculus & Physics                          |   |
| Sand down my stairs, before applying  wood filler and sanding them again | Keep up my style for new Web Designs, No good comes from being stale               | When I get new instruments, playing the Guitar or Piano again would be lovely.                           | Delve deeper into Java Projects and understanding    |   |
| Figure out good ways to declutter  our table and kitchen.                | Start picking up more advanced Javascript, React and Vue seem likely to benefit me | Start learning Python, some Javascript, C#                                                               | Prepare a roadmap to a Bachelors in Computer Science |   |

Now, these are all roadmaps, goals, working towards the next task and the like. While listing them here feels simple, actively getting into each task takes more time than I feel comfortable alloting to focusing on said task.
Should I be doing any personal studying over work and home tasks?
What if I mess up home tasks or find more that I feel I must do?
Then, when can I allot "free time" into my tasks to play games, make meals, watch videos, or hang out with friends?
Balancing tasks with personal habits and free time is a rather difficult endeavor to focus on. To do multiples of them at once and 'multitask', is a concept that deludes many to believe that this is possible.
#### From NPR's [Think You're Multitasking? Think Again]
>"People can't multitask very well, and when people say they can, they're deluding themselves," said neuroscientist Earl Miller. And, he said, "The brain is very good at deluding itself." ... **"You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly."**

As such, one beneficial factor to listening to music and working is that your mind concentrates on the work, pushing out most of the music *along with other noises* so as to not make them a distraction. But watching videos takes my eyes, what I use to program with, away from work. Playing games takes my full attention even for a split second which affects my thinking process for design as well. This means to finish the table I've made above, I have to discipline myself to get to work and keep that my focus.
Alongside this post, I'll provide hopefully helpful links to help any that come along this site.

I personally only have one thing to share: This reddit post on [r/getdisciplined](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/) speaks as directly as I can about this issue going long-term.

>Starting from the beginning, I grew up a fairly normal middle-class life. I excelled and raced through elementary school, consistently told by teachers, parents, grandparents, and family friends that I was extremely smart and that the world would bow to my every whim. Then getting into middle school, things started to slip...
